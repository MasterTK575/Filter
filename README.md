For this project, our task was to write different filters inside the helpers.c file. More specifically, we were to implement a grayscale filter, a reflection filter, a box blur filter and a filter that recognizes edges (lines that create a boundary between one object and another) in a picture. A file called filter.c, which provided boilerplate code for opening and closing the images was provided to us.
